this is the flow of my clients: firstly they land on this page
https://www.servizidiamond.it/ordina-i-tuoi-video-ads?lmref-test=CSmWdg

this page haven't any javascript code, it has only the reference of the lm.js script on the header
<script src="https://cdn.linkmink.com/lm-js/2.3.1/lm.js"></script>

after that when someone clicks on the buy button it will redirect on a stripe hosted checkout (the newly checkout like service)
when the checkout is completed the client is redirected to a success page
https://www.servizidiamond.it/modulo-creazione-video-ads

this is the javascript code of the page
https://github.com/ChrisCoder9000/LinkMinkStuff/blob/main/moduloCreazioneVideoAds

after that, when the module is filled and the send button is pressed, users will be redirected to the following success page which has no javascript code
https://www.servizidiamond.it/ringraziamenti-video-ads
